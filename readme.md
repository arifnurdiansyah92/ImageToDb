# Introduction
Before you clone/fork this project, let me tell you something about this project
Firstly in this project i convert images file to byte and store that in database

# How To Call Image
What we need to call the image is just fill the src in img tags with "data:image/png;base64,@{Convert.ToBase64String(***Your Img Variable***)}"

# Examples
You can find it in Index function of ImagesController
Or simply try to add Images in
